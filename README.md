## Hi there üëã

I'm Seb!

I work at the intersection of data strategy, AI enablement, and organizational systems thinking. Currently building sustainable approaches to AI adoption while exploring how we can use technology to create more thoughtful, connected communities.

## What I‚Äôm Working On

Building **cognitive-architecture.ca**
My digital garden + space for building, exploring, and thinking about knowledge, work, philosophy, systems building, and being a human - in the shadow of the AI era. I believe that we need to uncover and construct ways to preserve human wisdom, community, culture, and knowledge that are amplified by AI; not replaced by it.

**AI Partnership & Integration**

- Developing frameworks for responsible AI adoption in organizational contexts
- Building reusable prompt patterns and workflow systems
- Exploring Claude, Cursor, Copilot, and other AI tools for knowledge work enhancement

**Data Strategy & Culture**

- Designing data literacy programs and organizational capabilities
- Creating accessible analytics tools and decision-making frameworks
- Bridging technical implementation with strategic business outcomes

**Knowledge Systems & Personal Tooling**

- Building personal knowledge management systems with Obsidian as my primary thinking environment
- Experimenting with Maps of Content, digital gardening, and ‚Äúlearning in public‚Äù approaches
- Developing sustainable workflows for research, writing, and knowledge synthesis
- Exploring federated knowledge systems and community-confirmed learning

**Research & Writing**

- Long-range decision-making frameworks and their applications
- The intersection of sobriety, mental health, and professional growth
- Parenting with intention in a complex world
- How ancient wisdom traditions inform modern technological choices
- Responsible technology adoption and human-AI collaboration
- 

## Recent Explorations

- **Knowledge Systems Design**: Creating comprehensive frameworks for personal and organizational learning
- **Relational Reason Design**: How we can structure systems of knowledge to honour complexity, divergent perspectives, tension, and ambiguity.
- **Cross-Disciplinary Integration**: Applying insights from disparate fields to technical project management and decision-making
- **Organizational Cognition**: How groups think, learn, and make decisions in complex environments
- **Sustainable Change Leadership**: Moving beyond quick fixes to create lasting systemic improvements

## How I Think About Technology

I believe technology should amplify human capacity for wisdom, connection, and flourishing. My approach emphasizes:

- **Systems thinking** over isolated solutions
- **Ethical reflection** alongside technical implementation
- **Knowledge** as a _means_ not an _end_.
- **Community knowledge** over individual expertise
- **Sustainable practices** over optimization for its own sake
- **Authentic voice** in human-AI collaboration

## Currently Learning

```
Advanced prompt engineering patterns
Microsoft Fabric for integrated data platform development
Knowledge graph construction and federated learning  
Obsidian plugin development for enhanced knowledge workflows
Regenerative approaches to organizational change
```

## Let‚Äôs Connect

I‚Äôm always interested in conversations about responsible AI, knowledge systems design, and how we can use technology to create more thoughtful, connected communities.
